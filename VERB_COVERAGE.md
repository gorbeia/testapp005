# Basque verb coverage — a roadmap

A scoping reference for what `VERBS` would need to grow into for Aditzak to
give learners a reasonably complete picture of Basque (Euskara Batua) verb
conjugation. A lesson is built from three axes — **verb**, **tense/mood**, and
**agreement pattern (NOR-NORI-NORK)** — plus **grammatical person**, which cuts
across all of them. Each section marks what exists today (✅) vs. open ground
(🔲), so this can double as a checklist when picking the next verb/tense to add.

Today the app covers exactly one slice of this space: `izan` and `ukan`, in
`present`/`past`, with `nor` and `nor+nork` agreement, across six persons.

## 1. Grammatical persons (pertsonak)

| Person | App label | Status |
|---|---|---|
| ni | I | ✅ |
| hi | you (familiar) | ✅ — intimate/informal register ("hika") |
| zu | — | 🔲 **not modeled** — the everyday neutral "you" in spoken/written Batua (etymologically plural, used as the default polite/standard singular); arguably more essential for a learner than `hi`, which is reserved for close/informal relationships |
| hura | he / she / it | ✅ |
| gu | we | ✅ |
| zuek | you all | ✅ |
| haiek | they | ✅ |

Past these seven sits **allocutive agreement (hitano)**: when speaking *to*
someone as `hi`, finite verb forms change shape based on the addressee's
perceived gender — "toka" (`-k`) forms for a male addressee, "noka" (`-n`)
forms for a female one — independent of who the grammatical subject is (e.g.
"Etorri duk" / "Etorri dun" both mean "(s)he came", said to a male/female `hi`
respectively). It's the genuine ceiling of "full mastery," but a fine thing to
leave out of a learner-facing app for a long time.

## 2. Agreement patterns — NOR / NORI / NORK

`agreement` is already typed as a subset of `['nor', 'nori', 'nork']`. Four
combinations occur in the language:

| Pattern | What it marks | Example verbs | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `nor` | absolutive only — intransitive subject | izan, egon, joan, etorri, ibili | ✅ `izan` |
| `nor + nork` | absolutive object + ergative subject — transitive | ukan, eduki, eraman, ekarri, erabili, egin, ikusi | ✅ `ukan` |
| `nor + nori` | absolutive stimulus + dative experiencer — "psych" verbs | gustatu ("gustatzen zait" = I like it, lit. "it pleases to-me"), iruditu, interesatu, ahaztu, gertatu | 🔲 no example yet — produces some of Basque's most distinctive sentence patterns and is worth prioritizing |
| `nor + nori + nork` | all three arguments marked — ditransitive | eman, esan, erakutsi, saldu, bidali, eskaini | 🔲 the fullest expression of the system; good payoff once `nori` exists at all |

`AGREEMENT_META` already has copy and a badge style for `nori` — only the verb
data is missing to exercise it.

**Important wrinkle:** NOR-NORI and NOR-NORI-NORK agreement is *usually* carried
by `izan`'s and `ukan`'s synthetic auxiliary paradigms (`zait`/`zaio`/
`natzaio`... for NOR-NORI; `dio`/`diot`/`diet`... for NOR-NORI-NORK) rather
than by an independently-synthetic lexical verb — that's the route `gustatu`
and `iruditu` (both regular `-tu` participles, periphrastic) take; their
"conjugation table" *is* `izan`'s NOR-NORI auxiliary paradigm — see §4b.

But there *are* native synthetic exceptions, and they're a better first target
for `nor-nori` specifically: **`jario`** ("to flow/ooze" — "malkoak dario" =
"tears flow from him", "hitzak dario" = "words pour out of him") conjugates
directly (`dario`, `dariot`, `darizkio`...), no auxiliary needed. It's
defective — almost always used with an inanimate `nor` (tears, sweat, blood,
words) — so a lesson would naturally fix `nor` (mirroring `ukan`'s
`object: 'hura'`) and vary the table by **`nori` person** instead, which the
existing `conjugations` shape already supports. That makes `jario` a way to
land `nor-nori` *without* also having to stand up periphrastic-verb plumbing —
a cleaner, smaller first step than `gustatu`/`iruditu`. (`iritzi` → `deritzo`
is the parallel native-synthetic case for `nor-nori-nork`, "to deem/consider
[something] to be [something], to [someone]" — rarer and more literary, so a
weaker first pick than `eman`/`esan`.)

## 3. Tenses / moods (denborak eta moduak)

The app's two tenses are the indicative core. Roughly in the order a learner
would meet them next:

### 3a. Indicative (indikatiboa)
- **Oraina** (present) — naiz, dut, nago, nabil, noa, nator — ✅
- **Lehena / Iragana** (past) — nintzen, nuen, nengoen, nenbilen — ✅
- **Geroa** (future) — 🔲 the natural third tense. For the verbs above it's
  formed periphrastically (root + `-ko`/`-go` + auxiliary, e.g. "etorriko
  naiz" = "I will come"), so it reuses the existing auxiliary conjugations as
  scaffolding rather than requiring a whole new synthetic paradigm

### 3b. Conditional / hypothetical (baldintza / hipotetikoa) — 🔲
- **Baldintza** ("if" clauses): banintz, banu, banengo
- **Ondorioa** (the "would" result): nintzateke, nuke, nengoke

### 3c. Potential (ahalera) — 🔲
- Present: naiteke, dezaket, nagoke
- Past: nintekeen, nezakeen, nengokeen

### 3d. Subjunctive (subjuntiboa) — 🔲
- nadin, dezadan, nengoen — mostly appears embedded in subordinate clauses
  ("Nahi dut etor dadin" = "I want him/her to come")

### 3e. Imperative (agintera) — 🔲
- hadi / zaitez / zaitezte (be!), ezak / itzazu (have it!) — second-person
  only, so it's the one mood that can't fill the usual
  ni/hi/hura/gu/zuek/haiek table; it would need its own lesson/question shape

For **periphrastic verbs**, each "tense" above is actually a (non-finite verb
form × auxiliary tense) pair — e.g. "ibiltzen naiz" (present, habitual),
"ibili naiz" (present perfect), "ibiltzen nintzen" (past habitual), "ibiliko
naiz" (future). That's a second axis of complexity synthetic verbs don't have,
and is presumably what the `type: 'periphrastic'` plumbing is there for.

## 4. Verbs to cover

### 4a. Synthetic verbs (aditz trinkoak)
The lexical verbs Batua still conjugates directly (i.e. *they themselves*
take person/agreement endings, with no participle+auxiliary needed). The first
dozen are common, everyday `nor`/`nor-nork` verbs; `jario` is the odd one out —
rarer in conversation, but the cleanest native route to `nor-nori` (see the
wrinkle in §2):

| Verb | Meaning | Agreement | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| izan | to be | nor | ✅ |
| ukan | to have (auxiliary) | nor-nork | ✅ |
| egon | to be (located / in a state) | nor | 🔲 flagged in `DECISIONS.md` as needed before `izan`'s location/state example sentences can be written correctly |
| joan | to go | nor | 🔲 |
| etorri | to come | nor | 🔲 |
| ibili | to walk around / be doing | nor | 🔲 |
| eduki | to hold / keep / have | nor-nork | 🔲 |
| eraman | to carry / take | nor-nork | 🔲 |
| ekarri | to bring | nor-nork | 🔲 |
| erabili | to use | nor-nork | 🔲 |
| jakin | to know (a fact) | nor-nork | 🔲 |
| egin | to do / make | nor-nork | 🔲 |
| jario | to flow / ooze / stream ("malkoak dario" = tears flow from him) | nor-nori | 🔲 defective (effectively fixed `nor`, varies by `nori` person) — the lowest-friction way to land `nor-nori`: native synthetic, no auxiliary, fits the existing `object`-fixed `conjugations` shape |

### 4b. Representative periphrastic verbs (aditz perifrastikoak)
None yet — `TYPE_META.periphrastic` exists but no verb actually conjugates as
participle + auxiliary. Good first picks, chosen to cover distinct participle
endings, both auxiliaries, *and* the agreement patterns §4a structurally can't
reach:
- **`gustatu`/`iruditu`** ("to like"/"to seem", `-tu` participles) — the
  natural way to land `nor + nori` at all: their conjugation table is just
  `izan`'s NOR-NORI auxiliary forms (`gustatzen zait/zaio/zaigu...`), so
  picking either one buys both new agreement *and* a first periphrastic verb
  in a single addition
- **`eman`/`esan`** ("to give"/"to say", `-n` participles) — likewise the way
  to land `nor + nori + nork`, via `ukan`'s ditransitive auxiliary forms
  (`ematen dio/diot/diet...`)
- **other `-tu` verbs**: erosi (to buy), ikusi (to see)
- **`-i` verbs**: jan (to eat), edan (to drink)
- **`etorri`** is a natural bridge case: synthetic in present/past, but
  periphrastic in the other tenses

## 5. Suggested coverage checklist

Not a commitment — just a way to see how much runway sits past the current
`izan`/`ukan` × present/past × nor/nor-nork slice, roughly in priority order:

- [x] `nor` agreement, present + past — `izan`
- [x] `nor-nork` agreement, present + past — `ukan`
- [ ] `nor-nori` agreement, the low-friction way — `jario` (native synthetic,
      no new plumbing; per §4a)
- [ ] future tense, any verb/agreement — reuses existing auxiliary forms
- [ ] a first periphrastic verb (participle + auxiliary) — `gustatu`/`iruditu`
      double as *another*, auxiliary-driven route into `nor-nori` (per §4b)
- [ ] `nor-nori-nork` agreement — `eman`/`esan` (also periphrastic, per §4b),
      or the rarer native-synthetic `iritzi` → `deritzo`
- [ ] `zu` modeled as a person, alongside or instead of `hi`
- [ ] conditional / potential / subjunctive / imperative — stretch goals;
      imperative in particular needs its own lesson shape (no `ni`/`hura`/etc.)
